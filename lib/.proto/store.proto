// This file is auto-generated from source files in `/lib/.proto/*` using Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
//
// Protobuf is a language-neutral, platform-neutral serialization format. It allows users
// to define objects in a way thatâ€™s both efficient to store and fast to transmit over the network.
// These definitions are compiled into code that *enables different systems and programming languages
// to communicate in a byte-perfect manner*
//
// To update these structures, make changes to the source .proto files, then recompile
// to regenerate this file.
// These auto-generated files are easily recognized by checking for a `.pb.go` ending
